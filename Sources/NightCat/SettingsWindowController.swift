/// Hosts the Settings window in a standalone AppKit window.

/// NightCat is an `LSUIElement` menu-bar app with no Dock presence, so SwiftUI's
/// `Settings` scene doesn't reliably surface: `SettingsLink` (macOS 14+) never
/// activates an accessory app, and the `showSettingsWindow:` selector isn't a
/// dependable way to present the scene. A plain `NSWindow` gives precise control
/// over showing, focusing, and closing — the same reasoning as
/// `OnboardingController`.
///
/// The content arrives as a view factory rather than a concrete view, so this
/// file depends only on AppKit/SwiftUI and can be compiled into the unit-test
/// bundle (which can't link the app target).
